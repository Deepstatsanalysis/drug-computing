This directory provides the assignments in subdirectories.

## Manifest
- [`energy_minimization`](energy_minimization): Content for the energy minimization assignment; the key aspects are in a Jupyter notebook (`energy_minimization_assignment.ipynb`), but supporting files are also provided. An HTML version of the notebook for viewing ease is also provided, though it is not functional.
- [`MD`](MD): Content for Molecular Dynamics assignment, ONE of the assignments that can be chosen after the energy minimization assignment. The key aspects are in a Jupyter notebook (`MD/MD.ipynb`), but supporting files are also provided. An HTML version of the notebook is provided for viewing ease, though it is not functional.
- [`3D_structure_shape`](3D_structure_shape): Content for the 3D structure and shape assignment; the key aspect is the `3D_structure_shape_assignment.ipynb` file, but various supporting files are also present.
- [`MC`](MC): Content for Monte Carlo assignment, an assignment which can be chosen after the energy minimization assignment AND the Molecular Dynamics (MD) assignment. The key aspect is a Jupyter notebook (`MC/MC.ipynb`), but supporting files are also provided.
- [`library_searching`](library_searching): Content for library searching assignment, which builds on the 3D structure/shape assignment. The key material is a Jupyter notebook, but other files are also provided.
- [`visualization`](visualization): Contains PyMol movie making tutorial and the PyMol visualization assignment. Can be completed in either VMD or PyMol.
- [`solubility`](solubility): Contains solubility assignment, with examples and template in a Jupyter notebook.
