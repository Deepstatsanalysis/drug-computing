# Class 1 for PharmSci 175/275

This directory contains lecture/course material for the first class of PharmSci 175/275.

## Manifest
- [`Lec1_Python_Linux_vi.ipynb`](Lec1_Python_Linux_vi.ipynb): Jupyter notebook with *interactive* lecture slides and interactive Python content; utilizes [RISE](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/) for live rendering of python content.
- [`Lec1_Python_Linux_Vi.html`](Lec1_Python_Linux_vi.html): HTML version of the Jupyter notebook for quicker viewing, but is non-interactive and no longer uses slide format.
- `*.png`: Various supporting graphics utilized by the lecture
- `tmp.txt`: Text file utilized by the lecture

## Software requirements
**To run** the notebook you will need the standard course materials detailed in [getting started](../getting-started.md).
**To present** the notebook as in class, you will need to install [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/). *Note: Appears to be some incompatibility with some nbpresent features and nbextension features with RISE; it may need a relatively clean/fresh conda env to behave.*

## Usage information

When presenting, be sure to note that the `?` mark (presence toggled by `,`) allows access to help info.
Left and right arrow keys to advance/move back are obvious, but some other aspects are less obvious:
- `w` to enter/exit overview mode
- page up and page down to access sub-slides, which on Mac translate to `fn-down` and `fn-up`.
